# COMP3027-Assignment-1
Greedy Algorithm for finding the greedy optimal of total assignment marks. 
* This is actually not the best solution, using Map data structure is apparently not optimal.
* Can be done with 2 List I think.

# DO NOT PLAGIARISE! UNIVERSITY OF SYDNEY TAKES PLAGIARISM SERIOUSLY!!
* In the case of assignments being reuse, please do not copy! you will learn nothing from copying!
